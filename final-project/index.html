            <h1>Altin Shabani</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Altin Shabani, I am a passionate web designer with
                two years of experience in creating websites as such. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science from
                Georgian College.
                My expertise is more towards CSS, HTML, and JS. But recenetly i've taught myself to be skilled in PHP,
                and Python.
                I enjoy challenging projects as it brings out my best qualities. In my free time, I like to explore new
                web technologies and
                sharpen my skills. I'm also a photographer, and snowboarder.

                    <h3>Music App</h3>
                    <p>Using JavaScript I was to create a Music Applicataion where one was able to add a song to a big
                        list and either create a playlist or play the music itself.
                        This project took me the longest and it felt the best once I had finished it. I had to master
                        both JavaScript and SceneBuilder in order to properly finish this project.

                    <h3>Color Cycle</h3>
                    <p>Using Arduino Code I was to create a project where I had to create a green and red LED to the a
                        circuit with a RGB LED. I had to include 2 buttons. The first
                        button would toggle between the red and green LED. If the green LED is on when you hit button 2
                        the RGB will start cycling through the 3 colours. If the 2nd button is pressed the RGB lights
                        stop.
                        If the 1st button is pressed the RGB stops AND the green LED turn off and the red LED turns
                        ON. If the red LED is on, nothing happens when you press the 2nd button.</p>

                    <h3>Order Form</h3>
                    <p>Using PHP code I was to create a simple order form that would ask for a First name, Last name,
                        Email, and a Phone Number.
                        It would then ask for what program you are interested in at Georgian College. It would then ask
                        for your preferred mode of delivery.
                        After that you could click register and it would give you the best suitable programs.

                    <h3>Password Organizer</h3>
                    <p>My most favoured piece of work i've created. My password organizer. Using Python and numerous
                        modules such as PyPDF, Time, Re, Random, Openpyxl, and ezsheets. I was to create
                        a program that would ask for a password. Using the re and random modules it would tell you the
                        perplexity and strength of your password. Afterwards it would store the password and strength
                        into an excel sheet
                        that automatically gets created and formatted that is also encrypted with an encrypted password
                        that returns to your code.
